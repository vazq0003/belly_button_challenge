# belly_button_challenge
This is my Module 14 Challenge submission
For this assignment, I created an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbial species inhabiting human navels. 

I created a bar chart and a bubble chart from the data and made it interactive usind a drop down.
